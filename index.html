            We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore
            where the design works well and where it can be improved. We focus
            our process around one central question: “What can we do to make
            this design more efficient?”

            <h2>Deliverables</h2>
            <h3>A picture is worth a thousand words</h3>
            <p class="unlike">
              Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you
              what can be improved but also make revamps to the most critical
              parts of the design.
            </p>
            <h3>Design Report</h3>
            <p class="evaluate">
              We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and
              provide a detailed visual report with useful tips and design
              hacks. This would be the starting point for further work on the
              design.
            </p>
            <h3>Ways to Redesign</h3>
            <p class="provide">
              We provide several strategies for further redesign by various
              contractors, from freelancers to high-end agencies. We provide you
              with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign
              and quick but effective improvements.
